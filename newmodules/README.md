# newmodules

This is directory for new student modules (in the current semester).

Special branch is created for every semester and lecturer[s] will
put modules for public use/review. After a semester ends, the branch
will be purged (but valuable results will be archived somewhere).

##Winter semester

Modules for the `117raster` raster-image framework.

##Summer semester

Extensions which can be used in `048rtmontecarlo-script` and `062animation-script`
projects (Ray-tracing).

Please create one directory for each extension.
Name it
```
FirstnameSurename-ModuleName
```
The `ModuleName` is arbitrary name, please don§t use whitespaces in directoery and file names.

Each new module should contain documentation in the ;README.md;.
